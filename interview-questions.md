# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter like the "left and right lateral limit" of the function, meanwhile, the argument is what makes the function come into play. 

  Researched answer: Parameters are properties of a function. Arguments are properties of a particular call to a function. If you don't give a number of arguments equal to the number of parameters, the extra come across as undefined



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map(index, array, value), value being the only required parameter


  Researched answer: The built in method .map() takes in three predefined parameters: (value, index, array). The first, value, is the only required parameter and the second and third, index and array, are optional.  




3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map() will try to give you the same amount of elements in an array, while .filter() will try to give you a smaller amount of elements. 

  Researched answer: 
  - map: creates a new array made up of the results of calling a function, transforming every element in an array individually. 
  - filter: creates a new array that pass a given test by removing elements that don't belong



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Function is code designed to perform a specific task. Method belongs to an object, like a property that also has a function value.

  Researched answer: A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is when you get an array and split it into individual pieces of strings. 

  Researched answer: Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables. Destructuring does not change an array or any object, it makes a copy of the desired object or array element by assigning them in its own new variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is when a variable is declared and then defined after it has been called on
 
  Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared. Conceptually variable hoisting is often presented as the interpreter "splitting variable declaration and initialization, and moving (just) the declarations to the top of the code".




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: 
After creating a class (parent), you can create another class(child) that can inherit from the parent class while also having its own information. 

2. React: 
A Javascript library for creating user interfaces. Everything in React is component based, which means it is used to build small parts and join them to form the entire application.

3. React state: 
An object that stores a component's data that determines how the component renders and behaves. The state object lives inside the constructor method.

4. React lifecycle methods:  
Special methods for the component class to run the code when a component is changed.

5. DOM: 
Stands for 'Document Object Model' and represents the web page as a tree structure.
